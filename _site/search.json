      "description": "I am an evolutionary biologist and social psychologist\n(Ph. D. from University of New South Wales, Sydney Australia). <br><br>\n\nCurrently I work as a data analyst for the [Atlas of Living Australia](https://www.ala.org.au/). <br><br>\n\nI am interested in understanding evolutionary and cultural underpinnings of human behaviour; in particular, sexist attitudes and behaviours. I published a few papers on this at one point. <br><br>\n\nI value scientific transparency and reproducibility. I try to implement these practices as much as I can. <br><br>\n\nPassionate about music. Love all genres. I play piano sometimes.\n",
