title: "Evolutionary Biologist & Social Psychologist"
description: |
  I am an evolutionary biologist and social psychologist
  (Ph. D. from University of New South Wales, Sydney Australia). <br><br>
  
  Currently I work as a data analyst for the [Atlas of Living Australia](https://www.ala.org.au/). <br><br>

  I am interested in understanding evolutionary and cultural underpinnings of human behaviour; in particular, sexist attitudes and behaviours. I published a few papers on this at one point. <br><br>
  
  I value scientific transparency and reproducibility. I try to implement these practices as much as I can. <br><br>
  
  Passionate about music. Love all genres. I play piano sometimes.
