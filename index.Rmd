title: "About me:"
description: |
  I am an evolutionary biologist and social psychologist (Ph. D. from University of New South Wales, Sydney Australia). Currently a Data Analyst for the [Atlas of Living Australia](ala.org.au). <br><br>

  I am interested in understanding evolutionary and cultural underpinnings of human behaviour, in particular, sexist attitudes and behaviours. I published a few papers on this at one point. <br><br>
  
  I value scientific transparency and reproducibility. I try to practice this as much as I can. <br><br>
  
  Passionate about music. Love all genres. I play piano sometimes.
